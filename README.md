## Caffe for Dilation Network & Faster R-CNN

This is a fork of Caffe that support the training of dilation network
described in [this ICLR conference
paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122). It is updated with the master
branch of [BVLC/caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) at commit
[f28f5a](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/f28f5ae2f2453f42b5824723efc326a04dd16d85)
(June 27, 2016). The original README of Caffe is at
[README_caffe.md](https://github.com/fyu/caffe-dilation/blob/master/README_caffe.md).


### Added layer from caffe for faster r-cnn

    - RoI pooling Layer
		- Smooth L1 Layer
		- Modified caffe.proto


### Build

This fork perserves the compatibililty with vanilla Caffe. For help of
compiling this code, please turn to Caffe installation guide.

Makefile in this fork is changed slightly so that it is easier to
build caffe from different git branches at the same time. There are
some changes in the resulting build dir:

- git branch name is appended
after `${BUILD_DIR}`. So the actual build dir is
`${BUILD_DIR}_${GIT_BRANCH}`, such as `./build_master`.
- `${BUILD_DIR}_${GIT_BRANCH}/python` should be added to PYTHONPATH
instead of the python dir in the caffe source code.


### Usage

Please check [fyu/dilation](https://github.com/fyu/dilation/) for how
to use this code. The built caffe binary is used directly by
[dilation/train.py](https://github.com/fyu/dilation/blob/master/train.py).
